## DOCUMENTATION OF TURTLEBOT CAMERA CONFIGURATION

Class called "Brain" that takes in sensors and actuators as arguments to its constructor. The sensors include two cameras (camera_0 and camera_1), a laser (laser_0), and a 3D pose sensor (pose3d_0). The actuators include a motor (motors_0). The class has a method called "execute" that updates the pose data, sets the motor speeds to v=0 and w=0.8, captures images from the two cameras and laser data, and calls a method called "update_frame" to pass the data to a handler. The handler is an optional argument that can be passed to the constructor, and it is used to handle the captured data.

The class also has two additional methods: "update_frame" and "update_pose", which are used to update the frame data and pose data, respectively, by calling the corresponding methods of the handler object.
